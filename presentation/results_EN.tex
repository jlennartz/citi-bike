\begin{frame}{Current Best Solution: Simple, Digestible Rules}

    \vspace{0.3cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Time-based warnings:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Be extra careful during night hours and weekends
            \item Peak risk periods: Friday-Sunday evenings
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Location-based guidance:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Exercise caution in areas with low bike traffic
            \item Increased vigilance near highways and major intersections
            \item Avoid isolated routes during off-peak hours
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.4cm}
    \textbf{Future direction:} Predict dangerous areas ahead of time by integrating additional data sources (weather, traffic, events) and conduct careful re-analysis.
